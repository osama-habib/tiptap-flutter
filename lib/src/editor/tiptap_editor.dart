// The core editor content widget that renders the document, handles gestures,
// paints selections, and manages keyboard input.
//
// This widget is the Flutter equivalent of Tiptap React's <EditorContent />.
// It is a composable building block — it does NOT include a toolbar, scaffold,
// app bar, or debug overlay. Developers compose those separately:
//
//   Column(
//     children: [
//       TiptapToolbar(controller: controller),
//       Expanded(child: TiptapEditor(controller: controller)),
//     ],
//   )
//
// The widget manages the position registry for tap-to-cursor, the selection
// overlay for cursor/highlight painting, and the text input handler for
// keyboard input. It also places the invisible WebView in the widget tree
// (required by webview_flutter for the controller to function).
//
// Two pieces of input-side logic live in their own files and are owned by this
// widget rather than implemented inline:
//   - block_text_extractor.dart: the pure document-tree walk that produces the
//     text and cursor offset for the block under the cursor (carries the +1
//     serializer compensation). Called from the syncState path.
//   - typing_latency_tracker.dart: the keystroke-to-repaint pairing that
//     measures end-to-end typing latency.
//
// Native text selection adds three more owned pieces:
//   - selection_text_extractor.dart: the pure document-tree slice that
//     produces the plain text of a selected range, for clipboard Copy/Cut.
//   - selection_overlay_controls.dart: the platform-native drag handles and
//     drag magnifier, rendered in this widget's overlay Stack.
//   - The local preview-selection pattern, implemented here: during a
//     selection gesture (long-press word select, handle drag) the widget
//     holds a transient SelectionState computed entirely from the position
//     registry and feeds it to the painter and handles, committing to the
//     engine only when the gesture ends. This is a deliberate, bounded
//     exception to "the engine is the only state holder" — scoped to the
//     lifetime of one gesture — so the highlight tracks the finger without
//     a per-frame engine round-trip. The engine remains authoritative: its
//     next stateChanged supersedes the preview.
//
// Selection chrome geometry timing:
// Handle and toolbar positions come from RenderParagraph text-layout queries
// through the position registry. Those queries are only valid AFTER the
// frame's layout pass — and because the document renderer creates fresh
// GlobalKeys (and therefore fresh RenderParagraphs) on every rebuild, they
// are NEVER valid during the build phase (querying then throws the
// !debugNeedsLayout assertion). The widget therefore computes a cached
// SelectionChromeGeometry in a post-frame callback and renders the chrome
// from the cache, calling setState only when the geometry actually changed
// so the update loop settles after one extra frame. The painter is
// unaffected (it reads layout at paint time, which is always after layout),
// and gesture callbacks are unaffected (they run between frames, after the
// previous frame's layout). The visible cost is the chrome lagging content
// by one frame.

// Native-looking selection chrome for the editor: drag handles and the
// drag magnifier.
//
// "Native" here means reusing Flutter's platform-correct building blocks —
// materialTextSelectionControls / cupertinoTextSelectionControls for the
// handle visuals, and the Material/Cupertino magnifier widgets — while the
// positioning and gesture logic are driven by the editor through the
// PositionRegistry. No built-in Flutter widget understands ProseMirror
// positions, so the wiring is ours; the pixels are the platform's.
//
// The handles widget is a passive renderer: it draws handles at the
// endpoint geometry it is given and reports raw drag events back through
// callbacks. All selection logic lives in the editor widget.
//
// IMPORTANT — why handles take precomputed geometry instead of querying the
// PositionRegistry themselves: the registry resolves positions through
// RenderParagraph text-layout queries (getOffsetForCaret), which assert that
// the paragraph has been laid out. The document renderer creates fresh
// GlobalKeys (and therefore fresh RenderParagraphs) on every rebuild, so
// during the build phase those render objects are never laid out yet —
// querying them from a widget's build() throws the !debugNeedsLayout
// assertion. The editor therefore computes a [SelectionChromeGeometry] in a
// post-frame callback (after layout, when the registry is safe to read) and
// passes the cached result here. This widget must never call the registry
// during build.
//
// Layout convention: the editor places these widgets inside its overlay
// Stack; all geometry offsets are in that Stack's local space. Handle
// positions follow the SelectionOverlay convention: the handle's anchor
// point (from getHandleAnchor) is aligned to the selection endpoint, which
// is the BOTTOM of the caret at that position.

// Port-side performance instrumentation for the Tiptap bridge.
//
// These types collect timing measurements about the bridge and editor so the
// performance overlay can display them. They are NOT part of the engine
// protocol — they describe how the Flutter port observes its own behavior,
// not anything exchanged with the engine. Five things are measured:
//
//   - Command round-trips: how long a command takes from the moment it is
//     sent to the engine until its correlated response arrives.
//   - Engine load phases: how long each lifecycle transition takes during
//     cold start (loading -> pageLoaded -> engineGlobalReady -> schemaReady
//     -> ready).
//   - Typing latency: end-to-end time from a keystroke entering the editor's
//     input handler until the resulting document repaint completes. This is
//     measured by an in-order approximation (see [TypingSample]).
//   - Engine internal phases: how the engine spent the JavaScript-side slice
//     of a command's round-trip, reported by the engine as per-phase
//     durations (see [EngineTimings]). Unlike the three above — which the
//     port measures itself — these durations originate in the engine. The
//     port records them so the overlay can show where the round-trip's time
//     actually goes (transport vs engine compute), decomposing the round-trip
//     number the port already measures.
//   - Port phases: the Dart-side slice of a keystroke — decoding and parsing
//     a state event's JSON into typed payloads (recorded by the bridge), and
//     the state-driven frame's UI-thread build and raster-thread durations
//     (recorded by the editor's frame-timing recorder). These decompose the
//     remainder of the typing latency that the round-trip and engine phases
//     do not account for.
//
// [BridgeMetrics] is a plain mutable holder. The bridge owns one instance,
// records into it, and exposes it (plus a change stream) so the overlay can
// render live values.

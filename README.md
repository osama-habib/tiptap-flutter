The Tiptap JS engine runs your document logic; Flutter natively renders every pixel.

## Why this exists

If your web app uses Tiptap, your content is stored in Tiptap's document format — a JSON structure built on ProseMirror's document model. When you build a Flutter app for the same product, you need to read, render, and edit that same content. A from-scratch Dart editor won't understand Tiptap's format, extensions, or schema. You'd have to reimplement the entire ProseMirror document model, every extension's behavior, and keep it all in sync with the web app.

Porting ProseMirror to Dart would take years and kill compatibility with Tiptap's extension ecosystem. Instead of porting the code, we run the original code — the actual Tiptap JS engine, unmodified — and we render its document with native Flutter widgets.

That split is the whole idea: the engine and the renderer are two decoupled halves. The Tiptap JS bundle handles every document operation — parsing, schema validation, commands, transactions, undo/redo — exactly as it does on the web. Flutter independently owns the screen, drawing the document, cursor, selection, and images as native widgets. The engine computes; Flutter draws. Neither half reaches into the other's job.

Because the engine is the real Tiptap code, your Flutter app and web app share the same document format, the same extensions, and the same behavior. Because the renderer is pure Flutter, the editing surface looks and feels native — no document model from the engine is ever painted to the screen.

## How it compares to existing approaches

Most Flutter rich-text editors (super_editor, flutter_quill, appflowy_editor) implement their own document models from scratch. They work well for apps that start fresh, but they can't read or write Tiptap documents without a translation layer that inevitably loses fidelity. tiptap_flutter runs the real Tiptap engine, so there is no translation layer and no fidelity loss.

Some React Native solutions (like 10tap-editor) render ProseMirror in a visible WebView. That gives you the real engine, but the DOM _is_ the UI — so you also inherit WebView jank: keyboard issues, scroll conflicts, focus fighting, and a non-native feel.

tiptap_flutter decouples the two. The engine runs off-screen and produces a stream of document state; Flutter renders that state as native widgets. The engine's own rendering is never displayed — zero pixels from it reach the screen. You get full engine compatibility with a fully native editing surface.

## Architecture

The package is split into two parts, mirroring the engine/renderer decoupling at its core:

- **[tiptap-engine](https://github.com/blackcoffee2/tiptap-engine)** — a standalone JavaScript bundle that runs unmodified Tiptap as a headless engine. It handles all document operations: parsing, schema validation, commands, transactions, undo/redo. This is a separate project and can be used by ports for other frameworks beyond Flutter.

- **tiptap_flutter** — the Flutter port. It renders the document as native Flutter widgets, handles gestures and keyboard input, paints selections and cursors, and communicates with the engine over a JSON message bridge.

The engine runs inside an off-screen browser context — a WebView used purely as a compute surface, never as a display surface. ProseMirror needs a DOM to operate, so one exists; it is simply never shown. The WebView is laid out at zero effective size and excluded from Flutter's paint pass entirely, so none of its content is ever rendered or hit-tested. Every visible glyph, cursor, selection highlight, and image on screen is drawn by a Flutter widget, from the document state the engine emits.

Commands flow down to the engine as JSON. Events and responses flow back up through the same channel, correlated by command ID. The controller caches state for synchronous access and exposes streams for reactive UI updates. The engine's only output that reaches your app is data — never pixels.

## Supported content

The engine loads a fixed extension set: Tiptap v3 StarterKit plus the Image node. Both your Flutter app and web app share this set, so documents round-trip without fidelity loss across the following types:

- **Block nodes:** paragraph, heading, blockquote, bullet list, ordered list, list item, code block, horizontal rule, hard break, image
- **Marks:** bold, italic, strike, code, underline, link
- **Behaviors:** undo/redo history, drop cursor, gap cursor, list keymap, trailing node

Changing the extension set is a build-time change on the engine, not a runtime option from the Flutter side. See [Engine assets](#engine-assets) for rebuilding with a different set.

## Quick start

### 1. Add the dependency

```yaml
dependencies:
  tiptap_flutter: ^0.2.0
```

### 2. Create a controller and initialize

```dart
final controller = EditorController();

await controller.initialize(
  content: '<h1>Hello</h1><p>Start editing...</p>',
);
```

### 3. Compose the widgets

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: Column(
    children: [
      TiptapToolbar(controller: controller),
      Expanded(
        child: TiptapEditor(controller: controller),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### 4. Clean up

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Composable API

The package follows the same philosophy as Tiptap React — a headless core with composable UI components.

**EditorController** is the center of everything. It manages the engine lifecycle, sends commands, and exposes state streams. All widgets take a controller.

**TiptapEditor** is the content area — document rendering, gesture handling, selection painting, and keyboard input. This is the only required widget.

**TiptapToolbar** is a standalone formatting toolbar that listens to the controller and rebuilds when state changes. Place it anywhere.

**TiptapPerformanceOverlay** is an opt-in development tool that displays live timing metrics: engine cold-start phases, per-command round-trip statistics, and end-to-end typing latency. Detailed state, document, and bridge inspection is available through the console — the bridge logs every command, response, and event to the terminal during `flutter run`.

For full control, skip the provided widgets and build your own UI using the controller's streams and methods directly:

```dart
controller.editorStateStream.listen((state) {
  // state.doc — the full document tree
  // state.selection — current selection
  // state.activeMarks — active mark types
  // state.commandStates — all command states
});

await controller.execCommand('toggleBold');
await controller.execCommand('setHeading', {'level': 2});
await controller.setContent('<p>New content</p>');

final html = await controller.getHTML();
final json = await controller.getJSON();
```

## Reading and writing content

The editor supports full round-trip content — load a Tiptap document, let the user edit it, and get the modified content back in any format.

```dart
// Initialize with HTML or Tiptap JSON
await controller.initialize(content: '<h1>Hello</h1><p>Edit me</p>');

// Get the current content at any point
final html = await controller.getHTML();
final json = await controller.getJSON();
final text = await controller.getText();

// Replace the entire document
await controller.setContent('<p>Something new</p>');
```

To react to every change as the user types, listen to the editor state stream:

```dart
controller.editorStateStream.listen((state) {
  // Fires on every transaction — typing, formatting, undo, etc.
  // state.doc contains the full annotated document tree
  controller.getJSON().then((json) => saveToBackend(json));
});
```

This makes it straightforward to keep a backend in sync, build autosave, or wire up to any state management solution.

## Image insertion

The toolbar supports image insertion through a developer-provided callback. The library has no opinion on how images are sourced — you bring your own picker and upload logic.

```dart
TiptapToolbar(
  controller: controller,
  onPickImage: () async {
    // Use any image picker, upload service, or file source you want.
    final file = await ImagePicker().pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    if (file == null) return null;

    // Option A: Upload to your server and return the URL
    final url = await myUploadService.upload(file);
    return ImageInsertResult(src: url);

    // Option B: Convert to base64 data URI (simple, no server needed)
    // final bytes = await file.readAsBytes();
    // final base64 = base64Encode(bytes);
    // return ImageInsertResult(
    //   src: 'data:image/png;base64,$base64',
    //   alt: 'My image',
    // );
  },
)
```

If `onPickImage` is not provided, the image button is not shown in the toolbar. The renderer supports both network URLs and base64 data URIs.

## Custom node renderers

The standard node types are rendered by built-in builders registered through a `NodeRendererRegistry`. You can register your own builder for any node type, including overriding a built-in one:

```dart
NodeRendererRegistry.defaultRegistry.register('myCustomNode', (node, childBuilder, registry) {
  return MyCustomWidget(
    data: node.attrs,
    children: node.content?.map(childBuilder).toList(),
  );
});
```

Note that custom renderers only take effect for node types the engine actually emits. Because the engine's extension set is fixed (see [Supported content](#supported-content)), registering a renderer for a type outside that set has no effect until the engine is rebuilt to include it.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Android  | ✅ Supported                            |
| iOS      | ✅ Supported                            |
| Web      | ❌ Not applicable (use Tiptap directly) |
| Desktop  | ❌ Not supported                        |

## Known limitations

- Rich text paste is not supported; copy, cut, and paste work as plain text
- Hardware keyboard shortcuts beyond backspace and enter are not handled

## Performance notes

Always evaluate performance in a release build. Debug builds carry JIT compilation, live assertions, and heavier bridge overhead that are properties of the Flutter toolchain, not this package — debug figures are not representative of what users experience.

Each editor initialization spins up the off-screen engine and compiles the Tiptap JS bundle, a one-time cold-start cost paid when `initialize()` is called. Steady-state editing then communicates with the engine over the bridge per operation. The `TiptapPerformanceOverlay` exposes both costs so you can measure them on your target devices.

## Engine assets

The Tiptap engine JavaScript bundle is included in the package. No npm or Node.js is required to use it.

The engine is maintained separately at [tiptap-engine](https://github.com/blackcoffee2/tiptap-engine). If you need to rebuild it with a different extension set:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackcoffee2/tiptap-engine.git
cd tiptap-engine
npm install
npm run build
```
